//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written,
// and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have
// anything specific to write because your programs are too
// simple at this point, just add your name and the current
// date at the top of each program file. Then write one
// sentence describing what the program does.
//Exercise 10/11
//Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array
// called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each
// element in the list, one at a time.
//
var friend_names = ['Haris', 'Zahir', 'Arif', 'Shahab'];
for (var i = 0; i < friend_names.length; i++) {
    console.log(friend_names[i]);
