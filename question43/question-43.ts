/*Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 40.
 Call the function make_great() with a copy of the array of
  magicians’ names. Because the original array will be 
  unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate
   array. Call show_magicians() with each array to show that
    you have one array of the original names and one array with
     the Great added to each magician’s name.
