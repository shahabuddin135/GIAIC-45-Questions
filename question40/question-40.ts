/*Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds
 a Object describing a music album. The function should take
 in an artist name and an album title, and it should return
 a Object containing these two pieces of information.
 Use the function to make three dictionaries representing 
 different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects
 are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional      parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number
 of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value 
 for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object.
 Make at least one new function call that includes the number
 of tracks on an album.
