/*Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
 Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of
'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is
green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned
 5 points.

• Write one version of this program that passes the if
 test and another that fails. (The version that fails will
 have no output.)
